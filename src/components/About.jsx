          Centurion Maintenance Inc. established business in Denver Colorado on 10-3-2001 focusing on residential and commercial capital gains projects. As our journey leads us to Georgia 12-14-2022 we wanted to take a leap of faith and focus on sawmill log ripping for residential customers. Our goal is to provide a variety of lumber for future woodworking projects.
